# Conways Game of Life
This is my version of Conway’s Game of Life in JavaScript using p5.js. I created this project to make my own interactive background for my PC. I have a program called wallpaper engine that lets people create and upload custom wallpapers through the creation of a web app. So I created my own web app and uploaded it to wallpaper engine so that anyone can use it! You can check it out for yourself by installing wallpaper engine and subscribing to the steam workshop page below!

These first two images showcase Conway’s Game of Life in action as my very own PC background! I played around with the graphics quite a bit and found that having a trail life for each pixel creates a very beautiful effect. The user is able to click and drag their mouse over any region on the screen and it will bring those pixels back to life! This lets the user create more motion once the simulation comes to a halt.

These last two images show just a few of the different customizable color options. The user can pick any 2 rgb colors for the background and the pixels respectively. This lets the user make their wallpaper unique!
